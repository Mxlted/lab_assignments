# C Sorting Algorithm Labs

## Overview
Welcome to the C Sorting Algorithms Lab repository!

## Getting Started
Before diving into the sorting algorithms, ensure you have a basic understanding of C programming and a suitable development environment set up with a C compiler.

### Setting Up Your Environment
- **Windows:** Install MinGW or Cygwin for GCC.
- **Linux:** GCC is usually pre-installed; if not, install it via your package manager (e.g., `sudo apt-get install gcc`).
- **macOS:** Install GCC with Homebrew using `brew install gcc`.

## Sorting Algorithms
The repository is organized into sections.

Each directory contains:
- A README explaining the algorithm's concept, complexity, and use cases.
- Source code files with complete implementations.

## Contributing
Contributions are what make the open-source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**. If you have suggestions for additional sorting algorithms, improvements to existing ones, or educational content, please fork the repo and create a pull request or open an issue.

## Acknowledgments
- A big thank you to all contributors and educators who share their knowledge on sorting algorithms.
- Acknowledgment to various online resources, forums, and communities for providing insights and discussions on algorithm design and optimization.

Happy Sorting!
